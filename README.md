# This is Victoria's CosmoChatUI Mission
### The mission was to create a functioning AI chat bot. Some additional features include seeing previous chats and how many total chats there are. 
## Tools Used
### React.JS, Axios, OpenAI
## How to Use:
### Start by running npm run dev to start up the project
### You will be directed to the homepage where there is a Start Chat button, an empty chart, and a box for previous chats
### To begin a chat click the Start Chat button. You will be directed to the chat bot page.
### To ask the AI a question you simply type your input in the box at the bottom and click enter or the send button. The AI will form a response.
### To go back to the homepage click on the Back to Home button. The homepage will now store the new chat you created and add onto the counter in the empty bar chart
### You may go back to a previous chat by clicking on your chats in the chat history box. There are buttons for each of the chats with timestamps so you know which is most recent.
